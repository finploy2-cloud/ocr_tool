Got it! I’ll give you a step-by-step guide to push your local code from your PC to GitHub. I’ll assume you already have a GitHub account and Git installed on your PC.

Step 1: Install Git (if not already installed)

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
 and install Git.

After installation, open a terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell) and check installation:

git --version

Step 2: Create a repository on GitHub

Go to https://github.com
 and log in.

Click on “+” → New Repository.

Give it a name (e.g., my-project), add a description if you want.

Choose Public or Private.

Do not initialize with README (we’ll do that from PC).

Click Create repository.

After creation, GitHub will show you instructions to push an existing repo from your computer. Keep this page open.

Step 3: Initialize Git in your project folder

Open your terminal/PowerShell.

Navigate to your project folder:

cd path\to\your\project


Initialize Git:

git init


This creates a .git folder that tracks your project.

Step 4: Add your files to Git
git add .


. adds all files in your folder to staging.

You can also add specific files: git add filename.

Step 5: Commit your files
git commit -m "Initial commit"


The -m is for a commit message. Always write a short, descriptive message.

Step 6: Connect your local repo to GitHub

Copy the URL from the GitHub repository (either HTTPS or SSH). For HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git


origin is the default name for your GitHub repository.

Step 7: Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master


If you’re using main instead of master:

git push -u origin main


Git may ask for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if 2FA is enabled).

Step 8: Verify on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository page.

Refresh → You should see all your files uploaded.

✅ Done! Your local code is now on GitHub.

If you want, I can also give you a shortcut single-command way that combines steps 3–7 for a fresh project—it’s super quick.

Do you want me to give that?

C:\Users\user41>git --version
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that error means Git is not installed or not added to your system PATH. We need to fix that first. Follow these steps carefully:

Step 1: Download Git

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
.

Choose Windows and download the installer.

Step 2: Install Git

Run the downloaded .exe file.

Keep default settings as they are, but pay attention to:

“Adjusting your PATH environment” → select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”.
This ensures you can run git from Command Prompt.

Finish installation.

Step 3: Verify installation

Open a new Command Prompt (important: old CMD won’t detect Git yet).

Run:

git --version


You should see something like: git version 2.42.0.

Once this works, your PC is ready to push code to GitHub.

If you want, I can give you the full push-to-GitHub steps from here for a fresh project.

Do you want me to do that next?

i have already downloaded git
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Since Git is already downloaded, the problem is likely that Git is not in your system PATH, so Windows doesn’t know where to find it. Let’s fix that step by step.

Step 1: Add Git to your PATH

Press Win + S, type Environment Variables, and open “Edit the system environment variables.”

Click Environment Variables… at the bottom.

Under System variables, find Path, select it, and click Edit.

Click New and add the path where Git is installed. By default, it is usually:

C:\Program Files\Git\cmd


or

C:\Program Files\Git\bin


You can check the exact folder by looking where git.exe is on your PC.

Click OK on all windows to save.

Step 2: Verify Git works

Open a new Command Prompt (important, old windows won’t pick up the updated PATH).

Run:

git --version


You should now see the Git version, e.g., git version 2.42.0.

After this, your PC can run Git commands and you’ll be ready to push your code to GitHub.

If you want, I can now give you the exact commands to push your project to GitHub step by step.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
there is no Environment Variables at the bottom
ChatGPT said:

Ah, got it — sometimes Windows shows a slightly different layout depending on the version. Let’s go step by step with the alternative method:

Step 1: Open Environment Variables

Press Win + S and type “Edit system environment variables”, then open it.

In the System Properties window that opens, click the Advanced tab.

Click Environment Variables… (this button should be visible somewhere in the Advanced tab).

Step 2: Edit the PATH variable

Under System variables, scroll and find Path.

Select it → Click Edit.

Click New → Add the folder where git.exe is installed. Common default paths:

C:\Program Files\Git\cmd

C:\Program Files\Git\bin

Click OK to save, then OK again to close all windows.

Step 3: Verify Git

Open a new Command Prompt (important!).

Run:

git --version


If it shows the version, Git is ready.

If you want, I can now give you a ready-to-run sequence of commands to push your project to GitHub once Git works.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
D:\ocr_tool>git commit -m "Initial commit"
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'user41@DESKTOP-0IAA3KG.(none)')
ChatGPT said:

Ah! Git needs to know who is committing. You just need to configure your name and email.

Run these commands in your terminal:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"


Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

Replace "you@example.com" with your GitHub email (the email linked to your GitHub account).

The --global flag sets it for all repositories on your PC. If you want it only for this project, remove --global.

After this, try committing again:

git commit -m "Initial commit"


✅ It should work now.

Do you want me to continue with the push to GitHub steps next?
